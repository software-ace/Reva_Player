## Packaging Documentation

The active packaging documentation is under [packaging/](packaging/README.md):

- [DEB](packaging/DEB.md)
- [RPM](packaging/RPM.md)
- [AppImage](packaging/APPIMAGE.md)
- [Comparison](packaging/COMPARISON.md)
- [Recommendation](packaging/RECOMMENDATION.md)
- [Checklist](packaging/CHECKLIST.md)

Flatpak is mentioned in the public packaging status, but it is not documented as
a release path until a manifest exists.

## Repository-Verified Facts

- App display name: `Reva Player`.
- Executable target: `revaplayer`.
- App ID / desktop ID stem: `io.github.moayad30.revaplayer`.
- Current project version in CMake: `1.0.0`.
- UI framework: Qt Widgets, with Qt 6 default and Qt 5 selectable through `REVAPLAYER_QT_MAJOR`.
- Playback backend: libmpv through `infrastructure/mpv/`.
- Persistent store: SQLite through `infrastructure/storage/SqliteStore`.
- Runtime override for the database path: `REVAPLAYER_DB_PATH`.
- A legacy database environment fallback still exists in code for migration compatibility, but new docs and scripts should use only `REVAPLAYER_DB_PATH`.

## Documentation Notes

- Build commands are documented only when they exist in this repository.
- AppImage, bundled/offline DEB, and bundled/offline RPM build paths are supported by repository scripts. Flatpak is not implemented yet.
- The project contains both system-library DEB support through CPack and bundled/offline DEB support through `scripts/build-bundled-deb.sh`.
- AppImage support is implemented through `scripts/build-appimage.sh`, with fallback repacking through `scripts/repack-appimage-fallback.sh`.
- Bundled RPM support is implemented through `scripts/build-bundled-rpm.sh`.
